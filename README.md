# Blynk-Trap
<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
Differently abled individuals, particularly physically handicapped, encounter numerous challenges in their daily lives, including participating in digital activities and online gaming. Their limitations in using their hands or legs while maintaining normal vision can lead to feelings of disability, reduced self-confidence, and a sense of exclusion from their peers. However, these individuals share the same desire as others to engage in age-appropriate games. 
<h2>Abstract:</h2>
This project presents an innovative web-based game designed specifically to address the entertainment needs of individuals with physical disabilities, who often face limitations in using their hands or legs. The primary objective is to provide an inclusive gaming experience, allowing users to control the in-game cursor through eye movements. It also caters to individuals without physical disabilities who desire a relaxed and hands-free gaming experience, enhancing its versatility and appeal.
